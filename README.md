## Description

I created this webpage so that the end user can easily keep track of weather conditions across multiple cities as they plan their travel. By displaying information about today's weather, and the week's forecast, the end user has easy access to the information they need to plan ahead.

In creating this webpage, I employed multiple Server-Side APIs from https://openweathermap.org/ to retrieve data on city coordinates and real time weather information. Working on this project gave me the opportunity to practice utilizing APIs in conjunction with JavaScript in order to optimize the end user's interaction with the data.

## Usage

User can enter the name of any city and the webpage will display information about today's weather, as well as a 5-day forecast. Once a city has been searched, a button will be generated for that city. User can select this button to retrieve up to date data about that city at any time.
